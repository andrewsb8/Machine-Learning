# Machine-Learning

There are multiple projects contained within this respository that were created for
previous jobs, classes, and personal projects which are not big or involved enough to warrant their own repositories. They all involve machine learning methods in some way and most projects were coded from scratch as opposed to relying on external packages such as sci-kit learn or alternatives.

This repository demonstrates my ability to work with multiple languages and how I may explore or solve some problems.

There are additional READMEs in all of the child directories explaining what each folder contains.
