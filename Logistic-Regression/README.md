This directory holds various python scripts used during my employment at OptoQuest
which was a company in the Cleveland Clinic Incubator/Accelerator. The goal was
to develop models that predicted post-LASIK risk of developing ectasia.

These models develop logistic regression models based on patient clinical data
and finite element calculations of patient eye scans. All of these scripts were
written in 2018.
